# Shark Attack

  Project Completed
## Project objective

  This project focuses on training data cleaning skills along with getting familiar with various data manipulation methods and aproaches. Therefore, a hypothesis was assumed at the beginning of the project that would be confirmed or denied after the data analysis. After verifying the first hypothesis, another one, linked to the previous, would be assumed and cheked, and so on.
  
## Methods

  - Filtering
  - Grouping
  - Functional Programming
## Technologies 

  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Regex
## Project Description

  The dataset was extracted from the website Global Shark Attack File (https://www.sharkattackfile.net/). It contains occurrences of shark attacks around the world for many decades.

  1- Dataset contains:
  - 25723 entries

  2- Remove lines and collumns filles with NaN.
  - 6302 entries

  3- Hypothesis that man are most likely to be attacked than women.
  - 5096 out of 5733 attacks were on men (89%).

  4- Hypothesis that sharks preffer hunting youger men.
  - 1995 out of 2960 attacks were on young men (48%).

  5- Hypotesis that sharks focus on hunting american.
  - 830 out of 1995 attacks were on americans (42%).

  6- Hypotesis that the majority number of attacks occur in summer.
  - 353 out of 822 attacks occurred on summer (43%).
## Conclusion

  The data analysis validated all 4 hypothesis. 
  
  One thing tha must be taken into account is that the dataset has mostly american data, wich makes it unbalanced regarding to where the attacks happend.
