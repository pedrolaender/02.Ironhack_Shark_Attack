    "  This project focuses on training data cleaning skills along with getting familiar with various data manipulation methods and aproaches.\n",
    "  Therefore, a hypothesis was assumed at the beginning of the project that would be confirmed or denied after the data analysis. After verifying the first hypothesis, another one, linked to the previous, would be assumed and cheked, and so on.\n",
